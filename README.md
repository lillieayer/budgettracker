# Budget Tracker App

## Setup
1. Navigate to the github main page and click on the green "Code" button in the upper right-hand corner.
2. On the "HTTPS" tab, copy the link. Then, open Terminal, `cd` to a directory where you want to keep the project code, and run:
   
    ```git clone [LINK YOU COPIED]```
   
   You will need your GitHub username and [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

   ## Local Work
   1. Create a personal branch to work on each ticket/issue so all changes made to the main code can be created on secondary branches to preserve old code/manage merge conflicts
   2. In android studio, click Git tab in the upper bar and click Branches and create a new branch that you will work locally on and it will be synced to a remote branch when you push your changes
   3. When code is ready to be merged into the main branch, create a pull request on github
